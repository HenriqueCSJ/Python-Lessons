    Welcome to the greatest intellectual challenge of all time: Tic-Tac-Toe.
    This will be a showdown between your human brain and my silicon processor.

    You will make your move know by entering a number, 0-8. The number
    will correspond to the board position as illustrated:

                    0 | 1 | 2
                    ---------
                    3 | 4 | 5
                    ---------
                    6 | 7 | 8

    Prepare yourself human, the ultimate battle is about to begin! \n
